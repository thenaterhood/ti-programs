TI-84
============
A collection of TI-BASIC software written for the TI-84 calculator. Many of
these will also work on previous iterations of the TI graphic calculators
but some (such as Pong) may suffer some problems with speed.

Some of these programs will use parts of Matrix J to store persistent data
(high scores and such) or other letter variables. If you intend to use them
and have things you'd like to keep in Matrix J or other letter variables,
make sure you know what's going on so you don't lose anything important.

Disclaimer: I haven't written or updated a TI-BASIC program in a number of years
and haven't used any of these programs in roughly the same time. It was my
first foray into writing actual software. Unfortunately when these were built
I did not fully understand the joy of having well documented software.

Come on now, don't cheat
-----------
A number of these programs may help with or may solve problems commonly found
in high school and college level classes. I do not in any way condone cheating.
Learn the material properly and use these to check your answers. If you have
a programming background, the source code of some of these programs may even
serve as another explanation as to how to solve your problem.

Programs
-----------
Repository is laid out with plaintext files of source code in src, and .8xp
files that can be loaded directly onto a TI calculator in 8xp. 8xp files are
not compiled files, but are a binary format.

As its been some time since I've written and used any of these programs,
these descriptions may not be fully accurate and some reverse engineering
may be required to properly use the programs.

* ATOMS: a simple program for creating and reading chemical symbols and
creating orbital notations for atoms.
* AVERAGE: program that calculates a running average (mean) of numbers
* CHARGES1: program for calculating variables in physics equations dealing
with electricity.
* CIRCSERI: program for calculating details of an electrical circuit with
devices connected in series.
* FIBO: spits out the fibonacci sequence up to a number that the program
requests.
* INTRST: calculates compounding interest on a bank account
* LINE: calculates various things about lines such as slope, midpoint, and more
* MOLEMASS: calculates things to do with molar mass
* NEWTON1: Calculates one of Newton's equations. If you can't figure out F=ma
yourself, you're in bad shape.
* PONG5: A really basic pong game. Fifth iteration (this is the latest and
greatest with several problems solved). There are other iterations included
but may not have a plaintext file for them here since they aren't worthwhile.
* PRESSURE: converts pressure between different units.
* PTTOLINE: calculates the distance between a point and a line
* PULLEY1: constructs the equation for a frictionless weight being pulled
over a pulley with another weight on the other side.
* QUADRATI: calculates the roots of a quadratic equation and indicates
whether or not they are real.
* SEQSLOPE: Calculates the slope of a line through a series of points
